# Hackerrank submissions
This repository contains some of my solutions to programming challenges on Hackerrank (https://www.hackerrank.com/baptsc). 

I solve challenges on various subjects : graphs theory, optimization, strings manipulations, dynamic programming, path finding, etc. I push the most noteworthy ones to this repository. 

The solutions I push to this repository are passing all tests cases on Hackerrank.

I use only C++ to solve challenges.

Note : since we must submit code in a single file on Hackerrank, the whole solution to a problem is contained in a main.cpp in this repository. Sometimes when multiple classes are necessary to solve a challenge, it can make the file difficult to read, I do apologize for that.

Some of the most complex challenges I solved so far :
- "Floyd : City of Blinding Lights" (Dynamic programming, Graph theory Dijkstra/BFS algorithm)
- "Minimum Penalty Path" (Graph theory DFS algorithm)
- "Permutation game" (Optimization, Recursion, Dynamic programming)
- "Matrix Layer Rotation" (2D array manipulations)
